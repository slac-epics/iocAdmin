Release Notes for the ssi module
--------------------------------

ssi-R1-1-0-1: Cosmetic changes to bring it into conformance with EPICS R3.14.9.

ssi-R1-1-0: Nov 2, 2007
	First version for LCLS - changes for RTEMS and 505F.  From an email
        to SLS:
	(1) I don't have the slsDevLib utilities.  I assumed what these 
	    utilities do and I replaced them with code.  
	(2) The routines still only work for vxWorks - I use RTEMS.  
	    I changed them to use the osi devLib calls, removed 
	    vxWorks-specific include files, replaced vxWorks-specific typedefs 
	    with epics typedefs, added epics registration of the configure 
	    routine, etc, etc.
	(3) We normally use macros to access VME register space to enforce 
	    order of VME accesses in our PPCs - I changed all VME accesses to 
	    use those macros.
	(4) The SSI-552 doesn't support a CSR and I get a bus error if I 
	    attempt to read it like you are doing in your configuration 
	    routine.  So I added code to the init routine (not configure) to 
	    probe for it via devReadProbe and set a csrAvail flag used later.  
	(5) To support the 505F, I added other arguments to the configure 
	    routine and got rid of the unsupported arguments, like all the 
	    interrupt-related ones.
	(6) I added a utility to get the max counts (which depends on the 
	    number of bits which is settable in the 505F) which the linear 
	    conversion routines in device support use to calculate ESLO.
