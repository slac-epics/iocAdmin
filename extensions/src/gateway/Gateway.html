<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<h3><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h3>

<p>The Gateway is both a <a href="#ChannelAccess">Channel Access Server</a>
and <a href="#ChannelAccess">Channel Access Client</a> that provides a means
for many clients to access a process variable while making only one
connection to the server that owns the process variable. It also provides
additional access security beyond that on the server. It thus protects
critical servers while providing possibly restricted access to needed process
variables. The Gateway typically runs on a machine with multiple network
cards, and the clients and the server may be on different subnets.</p>

<p>Previous versions of the Gateway worked with EPICS 3.13 but required a
special version of base to build and work correctly. The required changes
were never incorporated into EPICS base. The latest of these versions is
Gateway 1.3. The new version, starting as Gateway 2.0, only works well with
EPICS 3.14.6 or later and does not otherwise require a special EPICS base. It
also has additional features compared to Gateway 1.3. Note that even if you
are using EPICS 3.13 for your other applications, you can still use Gateway
2.x built with EPICS 3.14 as your Gateway.</p>

<p>For this guide we will often refer to the clients as <a
href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/extensions/medm/index.php">MEDM</a> and
the server as an IOC. This is (1) to avoid confusion with the client and
server parts of the Gateway and (2) because MEDM and IOCs are the most
typical and most used client and servers and most people are familiar with
them. Keep in mind, however, that there are many other clients than MEDM and
there are other types of servers than an IOC. The Gateway is, in fact,
another type of server.</p>

<p>The following is a diagram of several MEDMs connected through the Gateway
to a process variable in an IOC. Without the Gateway there would be a
connection from each MEDM to the IOC. This uses up extra resources in the IOC
and causes additional traffic.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="Gateway Connections"
src="Gateway.Connections.gif"></p>

<p>In addition, these MEDMs can be restricted in their access to the process
variable. A typical scenario is to allow only read access. Note that the
MEDMs see the Gateway as just another server, and the IOCs see the Gateway as
just another client. The IOCs could be on a different subnet from the MEDMs,
and in fact, the IOCs might not even be visible to the MEDMs without the
Gateway. In the case where the IOCs and the MEDMs are on different subnets,
the Gateway would be on a machine that has two network interface cards, one
to the MEDM subnet and one to the IOC subnet.</p>

<p>At the APS the main Gateway is for people in the office building to
connect to the machine network with read access only. There can be many users
connected to popular process variables, such as the one for the beam current.
There is only the one Gateway connection, however, to the IOC with that
process variable. It is little affected by all these users and can go about
its primary responsibility of helping keep the accelerator running. This
Gateway typically has connections to on the order of 10,000-30,000 process
variables in on the order of 300 IOCs. In addition the APS has one Gateway
for each experimental team. These teams have read access to machine process
variables and read/write access to their own process variables. There are on
the order of 60 Gateways running at the APS.</p>

<p>In addition to connections to process variables in IOCs and other servers,
the Gateway, as a server, provides its own <a
href="#ProcessVariables">internal process variables</a>. These are used for
diagnostic purposes, to initiate reports, and to control the Gateway.</p>

<p>Internally the Gateway maintains two objects for each process variable.
There is a PV (Process Variable) object that handles the Gateway client
connections to the IOC, and there is a VC (Virtual Connection) object that
handles the Gateway server connections. Each VC has a list of Chan (Channel)
connections to the MEDMs. The PV object implements the client side of the
Gateway, and the VC object and its Chans implement the server side. The
following picture shows three typical states for these objects.</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="Gateway Internals"
src="Gateway.Internals.gif"></p>

<p>In the top state there is no connection to the IOC, either because it is
still trying to connect or because the connection has been lost. In that case
there is no VC, and the MEDMs see the process variable as not existing. In
this case the PV object is destroyed after two minutes unless it connects.
The middle state is most typical. There is a connection to the IOC, and each
MEDM is connected through the VC. In the lower state the PV is connected to
the IOC, but there are no MEDMs interested in the process variable. The PV
object and connection to the IOC are maintained for two hours after the last
time they are used in case another MEDM or other client wants to use it
again. The other client could be a command-line program like caget, that
requests the value and then exits. In that case the PV object will still stay
around for at least two hours.</p>

<p>When a Channel Access Client wants to connect to a process variable, it
send out a series of search requests, which are UDP packets, on the network.
These packets are initially sent at a very fast rate with the time between
them doubling at each try until 100 are sent or there is an affirmative
reply. Each server that gets such a packet is required to determine if it has
the process variable. When the Gateway gets such a request, it creates an
unconnected PV object that itself sends a search request to the IOCs. This PV
starts out as<strong> Connecting</strong>, and the Gateway responds to the
search request as postponed. If it does not connect in a very short time, it
becomes <strong>Dead</strong> and the Gateway responds to subsequent search
requests as not having it. If it is not found by the Gateway after two
minutes, the PV is destroyed. If it becomes connected to an IOC, its new
state depends on its old state. If it was <strong>Disconnected</strong> or
<strong>Dead</strong>, then it becomes <strong>Inactive</strong> and the next
<strong>Exist Test</strong> will return that it was found. If it was
<strong>Connecting</strong>, postponed <strong>Exist Tests</strong> are
processed, and if a VC is created because an MEDM is still interested, it
becomes <strong>Active</strong>. Soon afterward a Chan is created, and the
MEDM is connected to the VC and through it to the PV. Once the PV is
<strong>Active</strong> or <strong>Inactive</strong>, the Gateway responds to
subsequent search requests as having the process variable. If the connection
is then lost, the VC and its Chans are destroyed, and the PV becomes
<strong>Disconnected</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="#ProcessVariables">Internal process variables</a> in the Gateway
give the number of PVs in each state, and can be used to monitor its
behavior. In order to interpret the results, it is necessary to have an
understanding of these states.</p>

<p>PVs are either <strong>Connected</strong> or <strong>Unconnected</strong>.
<strong>Connected</strong> consists of either <strong>Active</strong> or
<strong>Inactive</strong>. <strong>Unconnected</strong> consists of
<strong>Connecting</strong>, <strong>Dead</strong>, or
<strong>Disconnected</strong>. The top state in the picture above is
<strong>Unconnected,</strong> but it is not clear whether it is
<strong>Connecting</strong>, <strong>Dead</strong>, or
<strong>Disconnected</strong>. The middle state is <strong>Connected
</strong>and<strong> Active</strong>. The bottom state is
<strong>Connected</strong> and <strong>Inactive</strong>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>total = connected + unconnected</li>
  <li>connected = active + inactive</li>
  <li>unconnected = connecting + dead + disconnected</li>
</ul>

<p>Saying this another way: the PVs for which the Gateway has an established
client connection with an IOC are<strong> Connected</strong>. Otherwise they
are <strong>Unconnected</strong>. For the <strong>Connected</strong> ones, if
there is a connection to an MEDM, then they are<strong> Active</strong>.
Otherwise they are <strong>Inactive</strong>. If they are
<strong>Unconnected</strong>, it may because they are
<strong>Disconnected</strong> (meaning formerly connected),
<strong>Connecting</strong>, or <strong>Dead</strong>.</p>

<p></p>

<p align="center"><img alt="Gateway PV States" src="GatewayPvStates.gif"></p>

<p>The Gateway handles most of the information about a process variable that
would be needed by most Channel Access Clients, in particular MEDM. An
exception is the RTYP field for records in an IOC. <a
href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/asd/controls/epics/EpicsDocumentation/ExtensionsManuals/MEDM/MEDM.html#PVInfoDialogBox">PvInfo
in MEDM</a> shows this field if directly connected to an IOC, but just shows
Not Available if through the Gateway. The field is the record type of the
process variable and is little used. It has not been deemed reasonable to add
the overhead to the Gateway to make it available. See the discussion under <a
href="#AlarmHandler">Alarm Handler</a> for more technical information on this
issue.</p>

href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/index.php">EPICS Documentation</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="History">History</a></h3>

<p>The Gateway was originally written by Jim Kowalkowski of the APS starting
in early 1996. Its basic concept and structure owes to him, but it was never
really finished and did not work well or reliably. Janet Anderson did some
work on it after Jim left the APS. Kenneth Evans took it over in 1999, and
made it work in a usable fashion. This required making several changes to
EPICS base, however. These changes were never officially incorporated into
EPICS base, and it hence required a special version of base to build the
Gateway. Ralph Lange of BESSY also worked on the earlier version and took the
Gateway over in 2001, adding regular expressions to the process variable
specifications and making it work with the Alarm Handler. Kenneth Evans
converted it to EPICS 3.14 in mid-2002, working with Jeff Hill of LANL, the
person in charge of <a href="#ChannelAccess">Channel Access</a>. New
features, including many more internal process variables were added, and it
was made to run on Linux and WIN32. There were problems with the early 3.14
versions of Channel Access, and these were slowly resolved over the period
from then until late summer 2003. It now works acceptably with EPICS 3.14.6
or later, uses the standard version of base, uses appreciably less CPU than
Gateway 1.3, and has a number of new features as well as some bug fixes.</p>

<p>A typical command line is:</p>
<pre>% gateway -log gateway.log -cip 164.54.3.255 -sip 164.54.188.65 -server</pre>

<p>For the command-line options that set environment variables, an
alternative would be to set them yourself before starting the Gateway instead
of using the option.</p>

<p>With EPICS 3.13, there should be no more than one portable server, such as
a Gateway, running on a workstation. The reason is that there is not
sufficient information in the beacons to distinguish among servers on the
same host. Clients such as MEDM must treat their beacons as one set of beacon
signals and will see sum and difference frequencies. They will likely
interpret this as an IOC coming up and will continuously reissue their
outstanding search requests. As a result, if the Gateway is one of two
portable servers on the same host, it will be causing a problem. Two servers
on the same host should not be a problem with 3.14 servers. It is not clear
what will happen with a mixture of 3.13 and 3.14 servers on the same
workstation. That situation should be avoided.</p>

<p>The Gateway makes two files, <strong>gateway.killer</strong> and
<strong>gateway.restart</strong>, when it starts. The file
<strong>gateway.killer</strong> contains a summary of the settings used, as
well as commands to kill the current Gateway, kill the server if in server
mode, execute the <a href="#Report">commands file</a>, and execute the <a
href="#Report">Process Variable Report</a>. It is a valid shell script, and
the only line not commented is the one which kills the server in server mode
or the current Gateway otherwise. Consequently, it can be run to kill the
server in server mode or the current Gateway otherwise. The other command
lines can be pasted to a shell to do the other actions. The file<strong>
gateway.restart</strong> can be used to kill the current Gateway, whether in
server mode or not. These files and features are not available on WIN32.</p>

<p>The Gateway can also create a file named <strong>gateway.reserve</strong>.
It does this to get around a problem that a process can only open files with
file descriptors (FDs) below a certain limit (256 on Solaris). If there are
connections to more than roughly this number of IOCs, not uncommon in a
production environment, there is no FD available to reread the <a
href="#AccessSecurity">access security</a> and <a href="#Report">command</a>
files. The Gateway gets around this by reserving a FD pointing to
<strong>gateway.reserve</strong>. Do not delete
<strong>gateway.reserve</strong>. Also note that if reading the access
security fails for this or any other reason, the access security will go to
the default, not what it was before the failure.</p>

<p>The number of threads on Linux is determined by the maximum user space,
about half of the 32-bit address space or about 2 GB. The maximum number of
threads is thus 2 GB divided by the stacksize (typically 10240 KB) giving
about 204 threads in the typical case. Channel Access uses two threads for
each IOC connection, one for receive and one for send. This limits the
Gateway from connecting to more than about 100 IOCs. If the stacksize were
decreased to say, 4096 KB (ulimit -s 4096), then about 256 IOCs would be
allowed. The APS Linux Gateway currently uses this number. Starting with Base
3.14.7, EPICS allocates memory for threads more efficiently, and you should
not have to change the stacksize.</p>

<h2><a name="Using">Using the Gateway</a></h2>

<p>To use the Gateway as your process variable server, it is usually only
necessary to set your EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST environment variable to the address
used for the -sip <a href="#Starting">command-line</a> option when the
Gateway was started. If want to use more than one server, add them all to the
list for EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST, separated by spaces. You probably also want to
set EPICS_CA_AUTO_ADDR_LIST to NO to prevent also searching the local network
for servers. You would certainly do this if there are IOCs on the local
network that might have process variables with the same names as ones the
Gateway would find. They would then be found from two servers, and your EPICS
application would likely complain. If the Gateway is using a non-standard
port, you need to set EPICS_CA_SERVER_PORT to the number used with -sport
when the Gateway was started. Then just run your EPICS application, for
example, MEDM.</p>

<p>To stop the Gateway, use the <strong>gateway.killer</strong> file
(described under <a href="#Starting">Starting the Gateway</a>), set the
<strong>gateway.quitFlag</strong> or <strong>gateway.quitServer</strong> flag
(described under <a href="#ProcessVariables">Gateway Process Variables</a>),
or kill it in the usual way for your operating system. It may take a while to
completely shut down. This is owing to EPICS cleanup processes that run after
the program has officially exited. These processes may also print error
messages after the Gateway prints its termination message just before calling
exit. It is a good idea to check that the Gateway has truly shut down. This
behavior may be corrected in future releases of base.</p>

<p></p>

<h2><a name="ErrorMessages">Error messages</a></h2>

<p>The Gateway gets error messages from several places, including internally,
the Channel Access Server library, and the Channel Access Client library.
These errors typically appear in the log. The Gateway internal messages
usually have a timestamp. Messages from the Channel Access Server library are
typically sent to the EPICS Errlog facility and are received by the Gateway,
often with different lines of the message being received separately. These
messages typically do not have a timestamp, and the Gateway puts a line in
the log with a timestamp when it thinks the message is complete. This line
will say "!!! Errlog message received (message is above)". You must try to
decide what lines above this line comprise the message. The problem is
compounded by the fact that other kinds of messages may be interspersed
between the lines for the Errlog message. The Channel Access Server library
can also write messages directly. The Channel Access Client library can use
the Errlog facility or send exception messages to the Gateway. The Errlog
messages are handled as described. The exception messages are printed with as
much additional information as is available and will start with a line with a
timestamp saying "gateServer::exCB: Channel Access Exception:". Common
exception messages, such as "Virtual circuit unresponsive" and "Virtual
circuit disconnect" only print a single, timestamped line without the
additional information. In most cases the Gateway prints a line with a
timestamp saying how it was terminated. If the process is killed with SIGKILL
(-9) or the machine is rebooted, this line has no chance to appear. In all
cases the Gateway attempts to timestamp messages as timing is often important

<p>The Gateway uses 3.14 makefiles as it can only be built with 3.14. To
build it you need to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Obtain base and put it at the same directory level as extensions. Use
    at least base 3.14.</li>
  <li>Do a make in base to build base.</li>
  <li>Obtain extensions/configure.</li>
  <li>Change extensions/configure/RELEASE so EPICS_BASE points to your
  base.</li>
  <li>Do a make in extensions/config.</li>
  <li>Obtain the GNU Regex extension and put it under
    extensions/src/gnuregex. (Or provide the GNU Regex routines another
  way.)</li>
  <li>Do a make in extensions/src/gnuregex.</li>
  <li>Obtain the Gateway directory and put it under
  extensions/src/gateway.</li>
  <li>Do a make in extensions/src/gateway.</li>
</ol>

<p>See your version of base for more information on the EPICS build system.
The Gateway can also be built with 3.13 makefiles, but you would have to
create Makefile and Makefile.Host yourself to do that.</p>

<h2><a name="AccessSecurity">Access Security</a></h2>

<p>The Gateway applies access security in addition to any access security
that may be implemented in the IOCs or other servers to which it connects. It
supplements but cannot override IOC access security. The access security is
specified in two files,<strong> gateway.pvlist</strong> and
<strong>gateway.access</strong>, by default. See -pvlist and -access on the<a
href="#Starting"> command line</a>. The first file,
<strong>gateway.pvlist</strong>, specifies what process variable name
patterns are allowed and denied, and is described in more detail below. The
second, <strong>gateway.access</strong>, specifies the access security rules.
These two files are read at startup.</p>

<p>The access security can be changed on demand by setting the internal
process variable <strong>gateway:newAsFlag</strong> (see<a
href="#ProcessVariables"> Gateway Process Variables</a>) or by using the
command file (see <a href="#Report">Reports</a>). This causes the two files
to be reread and the access security to be changed accordingly. After
rereading access security, the Gateway generates a beacon anomaly, which will
cause MEDMs to reissue search requests for unfound PVs.</p>

<p>Note that if reading the access security fails, the access security will
go to the default, not what it was before the failure.</p>

<p>The access security rules specified in <strong>gateway.access</strong> are
the same as used for access security in IOCs. In fact, both IOCs and the
Gateway use much of the same access-security code. These rules and the
concepts can be complicated and will not be reproduced in this document. See
the<a href="#ChannelAccess"> Application Developers Guide</a> for more
information. It can be noted that user names are case sensitive and host
names are not. WIN32 may use a different case than UNIX for the same account.
In this case user names must be entered with both versions. There is a sample
file, gateway.access, in the source distribution and reproduced <a
href="GATEWAY.access">here</a> to get you started. The version in the
distribution may be more recent.</p>

<p>The pvlist file is specific to the Gateway. Its function is to specify
what process variable name patterns are allowed or denied and to optionally
associate patterns with access security groups and security levels in the
access file. The patterns are GNU-style regular expressions. (See a UNIX book
for more information about regular expressions.) There is a sample file,
gateway.pvlist, in the source distribution and reproduced <a
href="GATEWAY.pvlist">here</a> to get you started. The version in the
distribution may be more recent. Directions for this file are in the sample
pvlist file as well as here.</p>

<p>The lines in the pvlist file are of the following four forms:</p>
<ol>
  <li>EVALUATION ORDER &lt;eval-order&gt;</li>
  <li>&lt;pv-name-pattern&gt; DENY [FROM] [&lt;host&gt; ...]</li>
  <li>&lt;pv-name-pattern&gt; ALIAS &lt;real-pv-name&gt; [&lt;asg&gt;
    [&lt;asl&gt;]]</li>
  <li>&lt;pv-name-pattern&gt; ALLOW [&lt;asg&gt; [&lt;asl&gt;]]</li>
</ol>

<p>where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&lt;eval-order&gt; is DENY, ALLOW or ALLOW, DENY</li>
  <li>&lt;pv-name-pattern&gt; is a regular expression that matches process
    variable names.</li>
  <li>&lt;host&gt; is an unqualified host name, e.g. hydra.</li>
  <li>&lt;real-pv-name&gt; is a substitution pattern that specifies the real
    process variable name. Occurrences of \1 ... \9 in &lt;real-pv-name&gt;
    are replaced by matched sub-expressions in the
  &lt;pv-name-pattern&gt;.</li>
  <li>&lt;asg&gt; is an access security group as specified in the access
    file. [The default group is DEFAULT.]</li>
  <li>&lt;asl&gt; is the access security level (0 or 1). These numbers
    pertain to the settings for particular fields in a record in an IOC.
    Permission for level 1 implies permission for level 0. See the<a
    href="#ChannelAccess"> Application Developers Guide</a> for more
    information on access security group and access security level.</li>
</ul>

<p>DENY FROM is not implemented by default when the Gateway is built. It
requires a special switch to be set for the build. It should not be
necessary. Use -ignore instead.</p>

<p><strong>EVALUATION ORDER</strong></p>

<p>This will set the evaluation order that is used when a client requests a
process variable. Setting this to "DENY, ALLOW" will allow access to a
process variable name that matches both a DENY and an ALLOW pattern. "ALLOW,
DENY" will make a DENY override an ALLOW for the same variable. (This is the
default.)</p>

<p>If DENY FROM is enabled, then matching DENY FROM host-name patterns will
always override matching ALLOW process-variable-name patterns.</p>

<p>Stated another way, the Gateway keeps three lists for: DENY FROM (if
enabled), DENY, and ALLOW. The DENY FROM list is searched first, and if the
host name is found, access is disallowed. If the order is ALLOW, DENY, the
DENY list is searched, and if the process variable name is found, access is
disallowed. Then the ALLOW list is searched, and if the name is found, access
is allowed, otherwise it is disallowed. Disallowed means the Gateway returns
that it does not have the process variable when the <strong>Exist
Test</strong> is called. In addition, for safety, it will not create a
connection to an MEDM.</p>

<p>The lines in the pvlist file are read from bottom to top. The first rule
in each list that matches is used, so the most general rules should be placed
first.</p>

<p><strong>DENY / DENY FROM</strong></p>

<p>The Gateway will ignore requests for any process variable that matches the
DENY pattern, depending on the EVALUATION ORDER and whether there is also an
ALLOW rule that matches. This can be used to block the Gateway from
responding to groups of process variables. DENY FROM will block the process
variables only for the given hosts. This can be useful to prevent loops
caused by forwarding to other Gateways. However, the host name lookup for
each <strong>Exist Test</strong> can take considerable time. Moreover, the
same result can be accomplished via the -ignore <a
href="#Starting">command-line</a> option. See the <a
href="#SymmetricGateways">symmetric Gateway</a> configuration below for an
example.</p>

<p><strong>ALIAS</strong></p>

<p>This defines a process variable alias and allows it as a pattern for names
which the Gateway should serve. For process variable names that match
&lt;pv-name-pattern&gt;, the Gateway translates the name into a real process
variable name and uses the real name as if it had been the one specified. The
&lt;real-pv-name&gt; may contain the special escape sequences \1 ... \9 which
will be replaced by the nth subexpression matched. See a UNIX book on regular
expressions for more information. There is an example in the<a
href="GATEWAY.pvlist"> sample pvlist file</a>. Access security rules to be
used for process variables matched by this pattern may be specified. If not
specified, the defaults are the DEFAULT group and level 1. Apart from
specifying an alias, this rule is functionally the same as ALLOW. Note that a
PV can only belong to one access group and access level. If you specify
access to a real PV via several different ALIAS or ALLOW rules that assign
different groups or levels to the PV, then which of these groups and levels
is used is undefined.</p>

<p><strong>ALLOW</strong></p>

<p>This is used to declare process variable names which the Gateway should
serve. Access security rules to be used for process variables matched by this
pattern may be specified. If not specified, the defaults are the DEFAULT
group and level 1.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Commands are not case sensitive.</li>
  <li>Patterns use GNU-style regular expressions. (See a UNIX book for
    information on regular expressions.)</li>
  <li>Any process variable not included in an ALLOW command is not allowed
    access.</li>
  <li>If no pvlist file is specified on the command line, a default rule ".*
    ALLOW" will be created to handle all process variables.</li>
  <li>The patterns are matched in reverse order; that is, you should always
    specify general rules before specific rules.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="PutLogging">Put Logging</a></h2>

<p>It is possible to log whenever someone writes to a process variable. (A
write is sometimes called a "put" and a read is called a "get".) To do this
you need to specify -putlog on the<a href="#Starting"> command line</a> when
the Gateway is started and specify a filename for the put logging. There
needs to be an access security group in the <strong>gateway.access</strong>
file that has a rule with WRITE and TRAPWRITE specified, for example,
"RULE(1,WRITE,TRAPWRITE)". (The security level could also be 0.) Then
whenever there is a write (or put) to any process variable in that group, it
will be logged in the specified putlog file. As with the log file, this file
will be automatically renamed whenever the Gateway restarts. An example may
be found in the<a href="GATEWAY.access"> sample access file</a>, where writes
are logged for process variables that belong to the GatewayAdmin group. Using
the <a href="GATEWAY.pvlist">sample pvlist file</a>, these would be those
that fit the pattern "gateway:*Flag".</p>

<h2><a name="BeaconAnomalies">Beacon Anomalies and Search Requests</a></h2>

<p>A server sends beacons, which are broadcast UDP packets, at regular
intervals, EPICS_CA_BEACON_PERIOD, 15 s by default. The clients, such as
MEDM, monitor these heartbeats. When there is a beacon anomaly, defined as
anything that is different from this regular pattern, the clients reissue
search requests for their unconnected PVs.</p>

<p>A client sends search requests when it wants to connect to a process
variable. A search request is a series of 100 UDP packets sent at
increasingly longer intervals. It takes approximately 8 min. to complete the
sequence. In most cases a server responds on the first or second packet; the
connection process between the server and the client begins; and the search
sequence ends. However for those PVs that are not found, the potential for a
connection to happen exists for approximately 8 min., as long as the packets
are still going out.</p>

<p>When client gets a hangup message from the server, it closes the TCP
connection, the process variable is marked as disconnected (MEDM screens turn
white), and search requests are reissued. In 3.13 when a client has no
communication from the server for EPICS_CA_CONN_TMO seconds (15 s by
default), it sends an "are you there" message to the server. If there is no
reply in 5 sec, it closes the TCP connection, the process variable is marked
as disconnected, and search requests are reissued, the same as for a hangup.
In 3.14, it marks the connection as disconnected, but does not close the TCP
connection nor reissue beacons. The client may get a "Virtual circuit
unresponsive" message. This is in part to prevent search-request storms under
bad network conditions.</p>

<p>When a server, including the Gateway comes up, it intentionally broadcasts
an irregular pattern for a short time (a particular form of beacon anomaly)
so the clients will know a new server is online and reissue their outstanding
search requests in case it might have those PVs. The Gateway also broadcasts
this irregular pattern when a PV beomes connected again after having been
disconnected and also when <a href="#AccessSecurity">access security</a> is
reread. This is so the MEDMs will know to try to reconnect.</p>

<p>For security reasons some network administrators will not allow UDP
broadcasts to cross subnet boundaries. If this is the case, then when the
MEDM is on a different subnet than the Gateway, it will not see beacons at
all and will not be able to tell if the Gateway has come up, This is a common
case in large installations. Owing to the length of the search request
sequence, if a server such as the Gateway goes down and comes back up within
approximately 8 min,. the MEDM will reconnect. Otherwise, it will not, unless
something else happens to make it reissue its searches. One such thing is to
try to connect to a new PV. This causes a client to reissue outstanding
searches along with the search for the new one. The latest versions of <a
href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/extensions/medm/index.php"> MEDM</a> and
<a
href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/extensions/StripTool/index.php">StripTool</a>
have a button to try to reconnect. In any event, Gateway administrators
should be careful to not have a long delay between killing and restarting a
Gateway if possible.</p>

<h2><a name="Report">Reports</a></h2>

<p>The Gateway prints three kinds of reports: (1) the Virtual Connection
Report, which includes all MEDM or other client connections to all process
variables; (2) the Process Variable Report, which includes all process
variables grouped by state; and (3) the Access Security Report, which
includes the allowed and denied process-variable patterns from the pvlist
file, <strong>gateway.pvlist</strong>, by default. The Gateway prints its
reports to the report file, <strong>gateway.report</strong>, by default,
appending them if the file already exists. These reports can be long.</p>

<p>The reports can be initiated by setting the associated <a
href="#ProcessVariables">internal process variable</a>, for example,
<strong>gateway:report1Flag</strong>, to 1. They can also be initiated by
sending a USR1 signal to the Gateway. (Use "kill -USR1
&lt;gateway-pid&gt;".). This causes the command file,
<strong>gateway.command</strong>, by default, to be read and the specified
reports executed. The command file can be modified to do any combination of
the three reports, as well as to reread the access security files. See the
-command <a href="#Starting">command-line option</a> for more details and an
example. The Process Variable Report can be executed by sending a USR2
signal. (Use "kill -USR2 &lt;gateway-pid&gt;".) The Gateway makes a file,
<strong>gateway.killer</strong>, when it starts. The commands and the correct
pids are printed in that file, so you can look at it to get the appropriate
command lines. Signals and the <strong>gateway.killer</strong> file are not
available on WIN32.</p>

<h2><a name="ServerMode">Server Mode</a></h2>

<p>The Gateway can be operated in server mode by specifying -server on the
command line. In this mode a server process is started that in turn starts
the regular Gateway process and then watches it and automatically restarts it
if it dies. Using this mode the Gateway can recover from crashes. The running
Gateway can effectively be reset by killing it via the<strong>
gateway:quitFlag</strong> process variable, by running
<strong>gateway.restart</strong>, or by killing the process in some other
way. When any of these methods is used or the Gateway crashes, a new instance
of the Gateway is started. The server process itself can be killed by setting
the <strong>gateway:quitServerFlag</strong>, by running
<strong>gateway.killer</strong>, or by otherwise killing the server process.
Then no more regular Gateway processes will be automatically started.</p>

<p>In order to avoid runaway creation of processes, there can only be ten
restarts in any ten-minute interval. If the number of restarts in this
interval exceeds this limit, the server will be stopped and no more processes
will be created.</p>

<p>This feature is not available on WIN32.</p>

<h2><a name="ProcessVariables">Gateway Process Variables</a></h2>

<p>The Gateway publishes several process variables, allowing you to control
it and monitor it. By default these have a prefix, which is the name of the
host machine, but this can be changed by -prefix in the<a href="#Starting">
command-line options</a>. Here, we will use the prefix "gateway". See the <a
href="#Introduction">Introduction</a> for a more detailed description of the
states and concepts.</p>

<p>The Gateway internal process variables are not record based as in an IOC.
They do have a DESC field, however. This avoids delays when using PvInfo in<a
href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/extensions/medm/index.php"> MEDM</a> and
allows <a
href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/extensions/StripTool/index.php">StripTool</a>
to put a description in the legend. In older versions of the Gateway, the
internal process variables used a dot as a separater rather than a colon.
When the DESC field was added, they were changed to use a colon. This makes
them more consistent with records in IOCs, and allows MEDM and StripTool to
properly determine the name for the DESC field. The sample <a
href="GATEWAY.pvlist">GATEWAY.pvlist</a> file shows how to set aliases if you
want to use the old names. The old names will cause MEDM and StripTool to not
correctly form the name for the DESC field, however. This will cause delays
for PvInfo in MEDM, and StripTool will not display the descriptions in the
legend.</p>

<p><strong>gateway:vctotal</strong></p>

<p>This is the total number of VC objects and should be the same as
<strong>gateway:active<strong>, except for short, transient
situations.</strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>gateway:pvtotal</strong></p>

<p>This is the number of PV objects.</p>

<p><strong>gateway:connected</strong></p>

<p>This is the number of connected PV objects, that is, process variables for
which the Gateway has a working connection to the IOC. The connections may be
<strong>Active</strong> or <strong>Inactive</strong>. In earlier versions of
the Gateway, this was named <strong>gateway:alive</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>gateway:active</strong></p>

<p>This is the number of <strong>Active</strong> connections. The connection
is <strong>Active</strong> if an MEDM is attached to the Gateway and using
the process variable</p>

<p><strong>gateway:inactive</strong></p>

<p>This is the number of <strong>Inactive</strong> connections. The
connection is <strong>Inactive</strong> if no MEDM connected to the Gateway
is using it.</p>

<p><strong>gateway:unconnected</strong></p>

<p>This is the number of PV objects which are <strong>Connecting</strong>,
<strong>Dead</strong>, or <strong>Disconnected</strong>. There is no working
connection to an IOC but the PV object is still around. There is no VC
object.</p>

<p><strong>gateway:connecting</strong></p>

<p>This is the number of PV objects which are <strong>Connnecting</strong>,
that is, which have just been created and are trying to connect to an IOC.</p>

<p><strong>gateway:disconnected</strong></p>

<p>This is the number of PV objects which are <strong>Disconnected</strong>,
that is, which were formerly connected but have lost the connection.</p>

<p><strong>gateway:dead</strong></p>

<p>This is the number of PV objects which are <strong>Dead</strong>, that is,
which did not connect and are scheduled for removal.</p>

<p><strong>gateway:fd</strong></p>

<p>This is the number of file descriptors in use by the gateway. This process
variable will only be available if registering file descriptors is enabled in
the Gateway when it is built. Not registering them appears to significantly
decrease the CPU usage, so this process variable will probably not be
available. It requires a special switch to be set when the Gateway is
built.</p>

<p><strong>gateway:clientEventRate</strong></p>

<p>This is the rate in Hz at which client events are happening. Client events
include such things as attempted read and writes, connection changes, value
changes, and access rights changes. They relate to communication from the
IOC.</p>

<p><strong>gateway:clientPostRate</strong></p>

<p>This is the rate in Hz at which events are posted from the VC object to
CAS and hence to the MEDMs. It is independent of the number of MEDMs
(providing there is at least one). It tends to be similar to the
clientEventRate; but only value changes cause post events. The other events
do not contribute.</p>

<p>In earlier versions of the Gateway this was named<strong>
gateway:postEventRate</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>gateway:existTestRate</strong></p>

<p>This is the rate in Hz at which the Gateway receives search requests. For
each search request, it has to do an <strong>Exist Test</strong> to see if it
has the process variable or not. If it is not already connected to the
process variable, it creates a PV object which itself initiates a series of
search requests to the IOCs. See the <a href="#Introduction">Introduction</a>
for more information on search requests. <strong>Exist Tests</strong> put a
load on the Gateway. For process variables that do not exist, there can be
many unsuccessful <strong>Exist Tests</strong>. See <a
href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/extensions/caSnooper/index.php">CaSnooper</a>
for a tool to monitor <strong>Exist Tests</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>gateway:loopRate</strong></p>

<p>This is the rate in Hz at which the Gateway executes its main loop. The
main loop consists of a call to CAS followed by a call to CAC followed by
Gateway housekeeping routines. The call to CAS lasts for 10 ms unless there
is activity on a file descriptor (in which case it returns early) or if it
takes longer than that to process its callbacks (in which case it returns
late). The call to CAC takes as long as it takes to do the work required. The
Gateway housekeeping typically uses comparatively little time. As the Gateway
becomes loaded down, the calls to CAS take longer and so do the calls to CAC
until eventually all the available CPU time is used. As the load increases,
the loopRate tends to decrease. However, no load can have a lower loop rate
than with some load because the call to CAS waits the whole 10 ms. It is a
rule of thumb that CAC should be called at least every 100 ms. By examining
the loopRate you can tell if this is happening. That is, it should remain
above 10 Hz.</p>

<p><strong>gateway:cpuFract</strong></p>

<p>This is the fraction of the available CPU time that is being used by the
Gateway; that is, the CPU time divided by the elapsed time. It is a good
monitor of the load on the Gateway. On WIN32 the cpuFract is always 1 and not
useful. This is owing to their implementation of the clock() function. On
Linux, threads are separate processes, and the CPU time for them is not
included, only that for the main process. This is because clock() on Linux
returns only the CPU time for the process that called it. If there is more
than one processor, the cpuFract could exceed unity. Note that Top on Linux
shows the CPU time divided by the number of processors and optionally lists
all threads separately. Thus, on Linux, the Gateway cpuFract should agree
with the Top value for the main Gateway process multiplied by the number of
processors. You can use Top to monitor the CPU time for all the Gateway
processes if you need that.</p>

<p><strong>gateway:load</strong></p>

<p>This is the load average for the machine on which the Gateway is running.
The load average is the number of processes in the system run queue averaged
over one minute. It is implemented by the getloadavg() function, and you can
look at the man page for more information. It is the same as the process
variable with the same name in IOCs. It is another way to monitor the load.
On WIN32 it is always zero and not useful.</p>

<p><strong>gateway:serverEventRate</strong></p>

<p>This is the rate in Hz at which CAS processes events. It tends to be the
clientEventRate multiplied by the number of MEDMs looking at the process
variable.</p>

<p><strong>gateway:serverPostRate</strong></p>

<p>This is the rate in Hz at which events are posted to CAS. If the Gateway
is keeping up, this will be very close to the serverEventRate. If not, it
will be higher and all posted events will not have been processed.</p>

<p><strong>gateway:commandFlag</strong></p>

<p>Writing a 1 to this process variable causes the command file to be
processed. The process variable is reset to 0 after the Command File is
processed. See the description of <a href="#Starting">command-line</a>
arguments and the <a href="#Report">Reports</a> section for a description of
the command file.</p>

<p><strong>gateway:report1Flag</strong></p>

<p>Writing a 1 to this process variable causes Report 1 to be appended to the
report file. Report 1 is the <a href="#Report">VC Report</a>.The process
variable is reset to 0 afterward.</p>

<p><strong>gateway:report2Flag</strong></p>

<p>Writing a 1 to this process variable causes Report 2 to be appended to the
report file. Report 2 is the <a href="#Report">PV Report</a>.The process
variable is reset to 0 afterward.</p>

<p><strong>gateway:report3Flag</strong></p>

<p>Writing a 1 to this process variable causes Report 3 to be appended to the
report file. Report 3 is the <a href="#Report">Access Security Report</a>.
The process variable is reset to 0 afterward.</p>

<p><strong>gateway:newAsFlag</strong></p>

<p>Writing a 1 to this process variable causes the access security files, by
default <strong>gateway.access</strong> and <strong>gateway.pvlist</strong>,
to be reread. The process variable is reset to 0 afterward. There is
currently a problem on some platforms that files can only be opened using
file descriptors 0 to 255. If there are many CA socket connections, there may
not be a file descriptor in this range available. In that case the access
security file will not be read and an error will appear in the log. There is
a workaround in the Gateway for this problem for Solaris.</p>

<p><strong>gateway:quitFlag</strong></p>

<p>Writing a 1 to this process variable causes the Gateway process to exit.
If the Gateway is in server mode, it will be restarted as a new process. In
that case it functions more as a reset.</p>

<p><strong>gateway:quitServerFlag</strong></p>

<p>Writing a 1 to this process variable causes the Gateway server process to
end, also ending the current gateway. No more Gateways will be started by the
current server. If the Gateway is not in server mode, it has the same effect
as <strong>gateway:quitFlag</strong>.</p>

<h2><a name="AlarmHandler">Alarm Handler</a></h2>

<p>The Alarm Handler works through the Gateway. The following discussion is
for those who understand Channel Access in more depth: For most process
variables the Gateway can get all of its information in a single DBR_TIME_xxx
structure, for example, DBR_TIME_DOUBLE, where xxx is the native type of the
process variable. These structures are defined in db_access.h. The Gateway
establishes an event handler for this structure and gets notified when it
changes and modifies it when it needs to be changed. There is only one
structure per process variable. This structure does not contain all the
information needed by the Alarm Handler, so the Gateway need to keep track of
another structure, DBR_STSACK_STRING. This is only done when needed. A
related issue is that the Gateway does not handle the RTYP field in a process
variable from an IOC. To do this it would have to handle DBR_CLASS_NAME. Each
structure the Gateway needs to handle adds to its overhead.</p>

<h2><a name="GUIInterface">GUI Interface</a></h2>

<p>Owing to its <a href="#ProcessVariables">published internal process
variables</a>, you can monitor and control the Gateway via MEDM or another
tool. You can set the writable internal process variables (if you have
access) and cause the Gateway to print reports, reread the access security
file, or quit. This is an example MEDM screen:</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="hydraStats.adl" src="hydraStats.adl.gif"></p>

<p>You could also add a Shell Command button to run a script to start the
Gateway. The MEDM ADL file for this screen is included in the Gateway
distribution as hydraStats.adl. Typically the Exec buttons operate so fast
that you will not see the value change from 0, and the Cancel button is of
little use. However, the chain of events is that the Exec button sets the
process variable to 1, the Gateway notices this during the cleanup phase of
the main loop, the appropriate action is executed, and the process variable
is reset to zero.</p>

<p>It is convenient to monitor and possibly record the state of the Gateway
using <a
href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/extensions/StripTool/index.php">StripTool.</a>
You could, of course, use any other EPICS monitoring tool of your choice.
This is an example of using StripTool:</p>

<p align="center"><img alt="hydra.rate.stp" src="hydra.rate.stp.gif"></p>

<p>The StripTool configuration file for this image is included in the Gateway
distribution as hydra.rate.stp. Note that for the example shown, the cpuFract
is low, the loop rate is high, and the postRate's and eventRate's are nearly
equal, indicating the Gateway is healthy.</p>

<p><a name="APSGatewaysScreen">This is a screen that shows the status of all
of the APS Gateways:</a></p>

<p align="center"><img alt="GatewayOverview.adl"
src="GatewayOverview.adl.Reduced.jpg"></p>

<p>(<a href="GatewayOverview.adl.gif">Click here for full-size image</a>)</p>

<p>The values for inactive and dead are not being used because these Gateways
are mostly using Gateway 1.3, and those process variables did not exist for
Gateway 1.3. This Gateway is running on the machine Hydra. The values for
Hydra84 and Rhea are white because these Gateways are not visible from Hydra.
Similarly, the Gateways running on Rhea and Hydra84 do not see the other two.
The Gateways labeled r431 through r438 are reverse Gateways that allow the
internal process variables for all the Gateways 1-34 to be seen on one MEDM
screen. See below for a discussion of <a href="#ReverseGateway">Reverse
Gateways</a>.</p>

<p>The existTestRate for the reverse Gateways, whose server side is on the
machine network, is similar to that seen by all IOCs and servers on the
machine network and is used for monitoring channel access activity on that
network.</p>

<h2><a name="Gateway">Gateway Configurations</a></h2>

<h3><a name="SymmetricGateways">Symmetric Gateways</a></h3>

<p>The following shows a configuration in which each of three networks has a
Gateway that finds process variables in IOCs on the other two networks. This
is a configuration used at BESSY.</p>

<p>However, note that if you are on say, Net A, and using the Gateway whose
server is on Net A, then the client side of this Gateway sees the server side
of the other two Gateways. However, these Gateways each see servers on Net A
and consequently see the Net A Gateway. Therefore, the Net A Gateway can see
process variables on IOCs on Net B and Net C directly and also through the
other two servers. To prevent this loop, each Gateway must be configured to
not allow process variables from the other two Gateways. This can be done
through the -ignore <a href="#Starting">command-line option</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<h3><a name="ReverseGateway">Reverse Gateway</a></h3>

<p>The following configuration shows a reverse Gateway. In this configuration
the four networks, Net A, Net B, Net C, and Net D, each has a Gateway that
gets process variables from Net Z. This is a configuration used at Argonne.
Net Z is the machine network, and the other networks belong to individual
experimental teams. These teams have read access to the machine network and
whatever access they want to the IOCs on their own network. Argonne at
present has eight of these configurations, most with four Gateways plus a
reverse Gateway. Owing to the reverse Gateways, the internal process
variables for all these Gateways can be seen on one MEDM screen, as in the <a
href="#APSGatewaysScreen">example above</a>, through a Gateway that sees
process variables on the machine network. One does not need (and typically
does not have) access to each of these private networks.</p>

<p>To prevent looping, the reverse Gateway only allows the internal process
variables from the other four Gateways and itself, and each of the other
Gateways denies the internal process variables from the other three. As a
result these four Gateways do not see internal process variables from the
other three. They do see the ones from other configurations of four. This
limitation could be overcome by using one reverse Gateway for every regular
Gateway. Note that another Gateway that is not on a network with the client
side of any of the reverse Gateways does not need to deny anything and can
see all the internal process variables from any of the Gateways in any of
these configurations (as in the <a href="#APSGatewaysScreen">example
above</a>).</p>

<h2><a name="AliasGateway">Alias Gateway</a></h2>

<p>It is possible to use the Gateway just to provide aliases for process
variables, and the following configuration shows an alias Gateway. Only one
subnet is needed. If an MEDM asks for the alias name, it is found through the
Gateway. If it uses the real name, it is found through the IOC. The two names
must be different to avoid finding the same process variable in two different
servers.</p>

<h2><a name="ChannelAccess">Channel Access</a></h2>

<p><strong>Channel Access</strong> [CA] is the part of EPICS that governs
communication between servers and clients. The two major parts are the
<strong>Channel Access Server</strong> [CAS] and <strong>Channel Access
Client</strong> [CAC, sometimes also just CA since there was originally no
CAS]. A CAC, such as MEDM, uses functions in the CAC library for
communication with EPICS and provides its own specific functionality on top
of that. A server uses the CAS library for communication with EPICS and also
provides its own specific functionality. A program that uses CAS is called a
<strong>Server Tool</strong> to distinguish it from the CAS library itself.
Servers that use CAS are called<strong> Portable Servers</strong>. The
Gateway is a ServerTool, a Portable Server, a Channel Access Server, and also
a Channel Access Client. There are also <strong>Soft IOC</strong>s, which,
like Portable Servers, run on platforms such as Solaris, WIN32, and Linux.
These do not currently use CAS and are not Portable Servers.</p>

<p>You can find out more information by looking at the EPICS Channel Access
Reference Manual and the Application Developers Guide. There is a version
included with each EPICS release. They can be found by starting at <a
href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/index.php">IOC Software</a> in the
<a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/docs">EPICS Documentation</a> and
following links to the release and point release of the desired EPICS
base.</p>
