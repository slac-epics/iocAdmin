# Used by higher level software to determine how to use PVs associated
# with the device.  This record is manually set by operations when the 
# state of the device changes.
# For example: Ops thinks the device is broken in some way.  
# They write an Artemis and put the device in MAINTENANCE.  
# The hardware guys fix the problem, solve the Artemis and put the 
# device in CHECKOUT.  Ops decides whether the device is working and 
# either marks it ONLINE or back to MAINTENANCE.
