PCDS Notes:
Note regarding no longer building iocAdmin.db:
iocAdmin.substitutions has been simplified to just use
iocSoft.db or iocHard.db.
Just follow the example in iocAdmin.substitutions to
update older iocAdmin.substitutions files to generate
hard vs soft IOC specific PV lists.

As part of this change, the PCDS screens directory is iocScreens
the rest of our screen links.   Also, the macro name for the
IOC prefix in the screens has been changed from "ioc" to "IOC"
to conform with the rest of our screens that all use IOC.
