#
# iocRelease.db
#
Contains a series of $IOC:RELEASE00 - $IOC:RELEASE19 stringin records
set to the first 20 module versions defined via $TOP/Makefile/RELEASE.

This file is created in your IOC by adding the following line to your TOP/*App/Db/Makefile:
IOCRELEASE_DB  +=  iocRelease.db

Then load iocRelease.db in your st.cmd, for example:
dbLoadRecords("db/iocRelease.db","IOC=IOC:SYS0:BD01")


#
# devIocInfo.db
#
We recommend loading devIocInfo.db in each IOC so scripts are able to
derive the IOC PV prefix and power outlet info from each device's PV prefix.

Records provided by devIocInfo.db:

stringout	$DEV:IOC_PV
stringout	$DEV:IOC_NAME
stringout	$DEV:COM_TYPE
stringout	$DEV:COM_PORT
stringout	$DEV:POWER_PV
longout		$DEV:SET_POWER_PV
stringout	$DEV:WEB_URL
stringout	$DEV:CAPTAR_TAG
waveform	$DEV:LAUNCH_EDM

Required macros:

DEV             Device PV prefix
IOC             IOC PV prefix
IOCNAME         IOC name, example: ioc-sxr-gmd

Optional macros, all default to Unspecifed:

POWER           Power control PV prefix
COM_TYPE		Device communication type: termSrv,usb,ethernet
COM_PORT		Device communications port, format depends on COM_TYPE
WEB_URL			Device web page URL, defaults to Unspecified
CAPTAR			Captar tag for primary device cable

POWER should be a PV compatible w/ our Leviton IOC usage

Note:

ioc/common/Leviton/R2.2.0 introduces a shortened name,
SetAction to replace SetControlAction
as the old PV names were all longer than 40 char and
thus would not fit in this $DEV:POWER_PV string record

To turn power off:    caput $(POWER)  0
To turn power on:     caput $(POWER)  1
To cycle power:       caput $(POWER)  2

COM_TYPE	COM_PORT scanf fmt		COM_PORT Examples
camLink		"Board %1d Chan %1d"	Board 0 Chan 1
ethernet	"%.40s"					gige-tst-gc1350c or 172.21.42.114
termSrv		"%.40[^:]:%d"			digi-sxr-01:3
usb			"%.40s"					/dev/bus/usb/002/003

Usage:

Install this file from your Db/Makefile via

DB_INSTALLS += $(IOC_ADMIN)/db/devIocInfo.db

Then add one of these lines for each device in your IOC to your st.cmd:

dbLoadRecords( "db/devIocInfo.db", "DEV=$(DEV),IOC=$(IOC_PV),IOCNAME=$(IOCNAME)" )
If you have other macros which are applicable, add them to the above line.

The $DEV:LAUNCH_EDM PV is a CHAR waveform, so you can't initialize it with a macro.

Instead, add a line like this in your st.cmd after iocInit.

dbpf $(DEV):LAUNCH_EDM "$(TOP)/build/iocBoot/$(IOCNAME)/edm-$(IOCNAME).cmd"

To launch the edm screen for a device, add a shell cmd widget running the command:

iocScreens/devLaunchEdm.sh $(DEV)

Long waveform of CHAR string w/ pathname for edm launch script

The $DEV:SET_POWER_PV record provides an easy way to control device power from edm or
via caput without having to fetch the POWER_PV string first.

It also provides a partial workaround for pre Leviton/R2.2.0 PV
names that are too big to fit in $DEV:POWER_PV.

Since $DEV:SET_POWER_PV is a longout record, it's OUT field which is not
length limited is set to "$POWER PP NMS" so you can write to SET_POWER_PV
to control outlets on older IOCs.
Also, python or other scripts can still extract the POWER_PV
from the $DEV:SET_POWER_PV.OUT field.


PCDS Notes:
Note regarding no longer building iocAdmin.db:
iocAdmin.substitutions has been simplified to just use
iocSoft.db or iocHard.db.

As part of this change, the PCDS screens directory is iocScreens
the rest of our screen links.   Also, the macro name for the
IOC prefix in the screens has been changed from "ioc" to "IOC"
to conform with the rest of our screens that all use IOC.
