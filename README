Note regarding no longer building iocAdmin.db:
iocAdmin.substitutions has been simplified to just use
iocSoft.db or iocHard.db.
Just follow the example in iocAdmin.substitutions to
update older iocAdmin.substitutions files to generate
hard vs soft IOC specific PV lists.

As part of this change, the screens link
has been changed from iocscreens to iocScreens to conform with
the rest of our screen links.   Also, the macro name for the
IOC prefix in the screens has been changed from "ioc" to "IOC"
to conform with the rest of our screens that all use IOC.

Changing the name of the screen link will allow for an easier
migration, as IOC's using prior iocAdmin versions will be able
to coexist with new iocAdmin IOC's during the migration.
