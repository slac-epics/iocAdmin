 *              RTEMS notes:
 *                - RTEMS also uses a 'workspace' memory
 *                  area which is independent of the malloc heap.
 *                  Some system-internal data structures are
 *                  allocated from the workspace area.
 *                  So far, support for monitoring the workspace area
 *                  has not been implemented (although it would be
 *                  straightforward to do.
 *
 *              The RTEMS/BSD stack has only one pool of mbufs
 *              and only uses two sizes: MSIZE (128b) for 'ordinary'
 *              mbufs, and MCLBYTES (2048b) for 'mbuf clusters'.
 *                 Therefore, the 'data' pool is empty. However,
 *              the calculation of MinDataMBuf always shows usage
 *              info of 100% free (but 100% of 0 is still 0).
